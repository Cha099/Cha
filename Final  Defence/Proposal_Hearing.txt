				The findings of this study would serve as input. The findings and 
                                conclusion are to come up with clear approved guidelines on the 
                                implementation of the software so that it would be clear to see as to who are 
                                the people responsible for the kiosks. The kiosk should be transferred near the 
                                Registrar’s office to become part of the basic services of the latter. If budget 
                                warrants, acquiring an additional unit of kiosk is highly recommended to ease 
                                the build-up queues of students patiently waiting to have their turn to use the 
                                system. However, the Institute of Information Technology shall make an 
                                alternative version of the system such as web-based and/or mobile apps for 
                                students to be able to access the system from home or anywhere through 
                                Internet connection. Thus, these require purchasing a web server. The system 
                                needs to undergo refinement of the system to make sure the continued use. 
                                There will be a trained software in-charge who may be responsible for the 
                                registration of students to avoid inaccuracy of account details during the 
                                registration. At the same time the said personnel or student-personnel will serve 
                                as the official person to attend students’ query upon notice by the Registrar’s 
                                office.
